# Lolapp üê±

A personal iOS application for tracking my cat's asthma symptoms, medication administration, and daily care routines. Built with SwiftUI and CloudKit for seamless synchronization across devices.

## Overview

This is a personal app I built to manage my cat's asthma care. It provides a simple, intuitive interface to track daily symptoms, medication schedules, food intake, and care notes. All data syncs automatically across my devices via iCloud.

## Features

### üìÖ Calendar Dashboard
- **Monthly calendar view** with visual health indicators
- **Quick cough tracking** - tap the + button to instantly log a cough for today
- **Color-coded cells** show cough frequency at a glance
- **Medication indicators** highlight scheduled treatment days

### üìù Daily Detail Tracking
- **Cough monitoring** with increment/decrement controls
- **Medication management** for both prednisone and asthma medications
  - Flexible dosage and frequency settings
  - Administration tracking with checkboxes
  - Support for once or twice daily schedules
- **Nutrition tracking** with detailed soft food logging
  - Set daily intake targets (default: 300g)
  - Log individual feeding sessions with timestamps
  - View progress toward daily goals
- **Daily notes** for observations and special circumstances

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Synchronization
- **Automatic iCloud sync** keeps data current across all devices
- **Offline support** - works without internet connection
- **Conflict resolution** ensures data integrity across devices

### üéØ Smart Data Management
- **Automatic log creation** - logs are created only when you enter data and deleted when the data is at default state
- **Clean interface** - empty days don't clutter the calendar, can clearly visualize which days contain logs
- **Persistent tracking** - never lose important health data

## Installation

## Note

This is a personal app created specifically for my cat's care routine. While the code is open source and you're welcome to fork and modify it for your own needs, the app is designed around my specific use case and may not work perfectly for other pets or care scenarios without modification.
